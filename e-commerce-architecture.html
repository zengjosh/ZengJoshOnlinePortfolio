<h1>PLTW 2.1.3 E-Commerce Architecture <span class="year">Cybersecurity 2025</span></h1>
</div>

 <p class="project-description">
    In this project, I designed and evaluated an e-commerce network architecture based on the fictional company Bikes, Boards, and Beyond (BBB). We developed a network topology that emphasizes the CIA Triad, or Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. The architecture incorporated components such as a firewall, network and internal routers, an API gateway, services, like inventory, cart, and order, a database, analytics, search services, and redundant web and product servers. We ensured that no servers were directly exposed to the internet, maintaining a secure and layered structure that safeguards customer and employee data through protected internal routing.
    <br><br>
    Through this activity, I deepened my understanding of how secure network infrastructure supports e-commerce operations. I learned the importance of internal segmentation, centralized databases for efficient data access, and the need to balance accessibility with security. Collaborating with peers helped refine my design, such as incorporating a search service after peer feedback. This project also reinforced the value of team norms like mutual respect, equal task distribution, and consistent support. Overall, it provided practical insight into securing large-scale systems while maintaining functionality and user experience.
