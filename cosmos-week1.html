  <h2>Objective</h2>

  <p class="project-description">
In the first week, we were tasked, in teams of two, to create a remote-controlled robot capable of popping balloons using weapons made from two 180-degree servos. The chassis and some sample code were the only information provided; the rest was up to us to decide, with the only requirement being that the robot had to fit within the provided size limit. The end goal was to create a robot that would be the last standing in a balloon-popping competition against the class.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Design Process</h2>

  <p class="project-description">
I was paired with Juha. On the first day, I was able to connect the Raspberry Pi to the network and install the required packages while she built the chassis. We worked together on connecting the Raspberry Pi to the motor drivers and successfully got them moving.
    <br><br>
The next couple of days were spent coding and debugging, trying to get the robot to respond to stick and button keystrokes on a game controller. Detecting whether a key was pressed was simple, but determining when the key was held had us stumped for a while. This meant that with our current code, the only way to move the robot was to spam the stick keys. Rather than perfecting movement, we continued onward to the servos and started weapon design.
    <br><br>
The servos required a PWM driver, which we added to the breadboard. The top buttons on the left and right sides of the controllers were programmed to turn the servos. After brainstorming countless weapon ideas, we decided on a pincer attack, checking our criteria for simplicity and effectiveness at popping balloons.
    <br><br>
Since I had done most of the coding up to this point, Juha and I swapped roles: I began designing the weapons we planned, while she worked on creating features for the unused buttons and figuring out the enigma of holding a button to move. Having almost no experience with actual hardware or physics, I was completely lost. In the process of designing weapons, I created unstable arms that were overly large and threw off the center of mass. Luckily, while testing, we caught these errors and fixed them by readjusting the placement of the breadboard, batteries, and portable charger.
    <br><br>
As Friday, the competition day, approached, more and more features began appearing, including the long-awaited hold-to-move feature. This resulted in our robot taking on a distinct look, covered with black electrical tape and blue masking tape. Forced to choose a team name, and due to our lack of creativity, we settled on the name <i>Tapebot</i>.

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p class="project-description">

This project introduced many firsts for me. This was my first time working with a Raspberry Pi, my first time using motor and PWM drivers, and my first time using a Linux-based operating system. I had almost zero prior knowledge, with the exception of programming, but by the end of the week, I'd started feeling comfortable with navigating around Linux, understanding the new libraries needed for the RPi, and grasped a basic understanding of the components I was working with.
