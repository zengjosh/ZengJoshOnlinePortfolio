<h1>Polka Dot Game <span class="year">CSP 2023</span></h1>
</div>

 <p class="project-description">
In 2023, I developed a game heavily inspired by the Polka Dot Game. In this game, players control a dot and consume smaller dots to gain points. However, contact with larger dots results in the game ending, along with a display of the player's dot consumption stats.

<br><br>
Additionally, I made a difficulty selection feature, offering players a choice between three levels: easy, medium, or hard. The system restricts input to these three options, ensuring that the user interaction won't break the game.

<br><br>
The player-controlled dot dynamically follows the cursor, enhancing user engagement, and the other dots cease movement and are removed once they exit the user's screen. This optimization minimizes resource consumption during gameplay.
