    Hi, I’m Josh, a senior at Dublin High School and a member of the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy. My passion for computer science has grown throughout high school, and I’m excited to pursue this field in college. What excites me most about computer science is the wide range of opportunities it offers, allowing me to specialize in areas that genuinely interest me.
    <br><br>
    I’ve built a solid foundation in computer science through courses like Computer Science Essentials, AP Computer Science Principles, and AP Computer Science Applications. Starting with block code and Python in Essentials, I expanded my skills in Principles with collaborative projects using the SCRUM development process, enhancing my understanding of coding in Python, documenting projects, and managing teamwork. AP Computer Science Applications introduced me to Java and version control on GitHub, further building my skillset.
    <br><br>
    Outside the classroom, I also started self-studying other languages like C++, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and learning more advanced libraries with Python for various projects, like OpenCV for video processing, TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning models, and web development to create apps for both my projects and collaboration with peers. 
    <br><br>
    Today, I’m proficient in Python (and modules like PyGame, Turtle Graphics, and Flask), Java, C++, HTML, and CSS (this portfolio was created with HTML and CSS). You can view my projects in the Projects section, where I’ve explored various IDEs like Visual Studio Code and Replit and experimented with workflows, including feature branching and centralized setups for team environments.
    <br><br>
    In the near future, my goal is to continue expanding my knowledge through a four-year college program. Looking further ahead, I hope to leverage technology to address real-world challenges and leave a lasting impact, creating solutions that make life easier and more connected through the power of the internet.
