    <p>
Hey, I’m Josh and I am currently a Junior at Dublin High School and a part of the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy. During my time in high school, I’ve found myself interested in computer science, and I’m definitely going to pursue this passion in college once I graduate. What interests me most about this field is the vast amount of options that are available to me, and I am able to choose to specialize into specific areas that I enjoy. 
<br><br>
Courses I’ve taken that have really enhanced my knowledge in computer science include Computer Science Essentials, AP Computer Science Principles, and AP Computer Science Applications. In Computer Science Essentials, I got to learn the basics of programming, block code for creating a mobile app, and Python. AP Computer Science Principles expanded on Python, focusing on specific modules like Turtle Graphics, the SCRUM development process, and keeping good documentation for code, as many of the projects done were in a collaborative environment. Finally, AP Computer Science Applications had me learn Java, and introduced me to GitHub. 
<br><br>
So far, I have become familiar with Python and some of its modules(PyGame, Turtle Graphics, and Flask), as well as Java, C++, HTML, and CSS (this online portfolio was actually made with HTML and CSS), and have done a variety of projects with them, which you can check out under the Projects section. I’ve also had time to explore different IDEs, like Visual Studio Code and Replit, as well as platforms like GitHub to store the projects I’ve done. With GitHub, I’ve been able to try different workflows, like feature branching and a centralized workflow for team environments. 
<br><br>
My goal for the short-term future is to continue expanding my knowledge in this field, through attending a four year college. Long-term, I hope to leave a lasting impact in the world, fixing real world problems through the internet.
