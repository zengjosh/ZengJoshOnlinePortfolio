        I am currently a student at Dublin High School, seeking to be a part of the computer science field. Aspects of this that appeal to me include overcoming problems (such as bugs that appear in my code) and delivering a final product that is useful and meaningful, meaning that I will submit a project that meets the criteria. This field is exciting because it's something new I am currently exploring, which allows for more room to learn and improve. Even though this field might require learning quickly, I want to pursue it because of my passion for learning new things and creating things that will be useful to me later on.

        <br>

        In order to be successful in the engineering field, a student needs to be teachable and productive. I demonstrate the characteristic of productiveness when I work on school assignments by managing my time to make sure I can finish everything within a set timeframe. Being teachable is another important trait, which I have used to learn new skills and be the best I can be. In high school, I have developed the skill of being self-reliant. I have used this to figure most things out myself and help others when needed. I have also dedicated my time to studying and finishing assignments. From these experiences, I gained dedication. One achievement I am proud of is balancing work and life. This will help in the field of engineering because I can always feel comfortable with the projects I am assigned, which in turn will make me more efficient
        <br>
        <br>
        Ultimately, working in computer science is appealing because it appeals to my interests and gives me the opportunity to learn new things. Using my characteristics, I hope to earn a position in the field of computer science. Thank you for reading this letter, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
        <br>

        Best,
