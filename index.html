        I am currently a student at Dublin High School, seeking to be a part of the computer science field. Aspects of this that appeal to me include overcoming problems (such as bugs that appear in my code) and delivering a final product that is useful and meaningful, meaning that I will submit a project that meets the criteria. This field is exciting because it's something new I am currently exploring, which allows for more room to learn and improve. Even though this field might require learning quickly, I want to pursue it because of my passion for learning new things and creating things that will be useful to me later on.

        In order to be successful in the engineering field, a student needs to be teachable and productive. I demonstrate the characteristic of productiveness when I work on school assignments by managing my time to make sure I can finish everything within a set timeframe. Being teachable is another important trait, which I have used to learn new skills and be the best I can be. In high school, I have developed the skill of being self-reliant. I have used this to figure most things out myself and help others when needed. I have also dedicated my time to studying and finishing assignments. From these experiences, I gained dedication. One achievement I am proud of is balancing work and life. This will help in the field of engineering because I can always feel comfortable with the projects I am assigned, which in turn will make me more efficient
        <br>
        <br>
        Ultimately, working in computer science is appealing because it appeals to my interests and gives me the opportunity to learn new things. Using my characteristics, I hope to earn a position in the field of computer science. Thank you for reading this letter, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        Best,
