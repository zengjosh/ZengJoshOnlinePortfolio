<h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="text-column">
      <p>
I am currently a student at Dublin High School, seeking to be a part of the computer science field. Aspects of this that appeal to me include overcoming problems (such as bugs that appear in my code) and delivering a final product that is useful and meaningful, as well as one that meets the criteria. This field is exciting to me because it's possible to continuously improve on current skills. Even though this field might require knowledge from a variety of other subjects, I want to pursue it because of my passion for learning new things and creating things that I am passionate about.
<br><br>
In order to be successful in the engineering field, a student needs to be passionate and productive. I demonstrate the characteristic of productiveness when I work on school assignments (including 5 AP classes) by managing my time to make sure I can finish everything within a set timeframe. Being passionate is another important trait, as that keeps me motivated, whether its debugging a program or learning new things. One accomplishment I am most proud of in my time in computer science is creating a fully functional game in python that is both visually appealing and fun to play (Polka Dot Game under Projects tab).
<br><br>
Ultimately, working in computer science is appealing because it appeals to my interests and gives me the opportunity to learn new things. Using my characteristics, I hope to earn a position in the field of computer science. Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
