 Mr. Brown works as a Senior Product Instructor at Workday, a global company specializing in cloud-based software solutions for human capital management and financial management. In his talk, he:</p>
  <ul class="bulletpoints">
   <li>Introduced Workday as a provider of enterprise cloud applications, and its large influence throughout the world</li>
   <li>Explained his job, which involves teaching new hires, customers, and consultants how to use Workdayâ€™s software. To effectively do this, he creates learning materials to help people understand complex systems</li>
   <li>Went over the importance of Object Oriented Programming, as it helps employees navigate the software more effectively, even if they aren't full-time developers.</li>
   <li>Discussed some basics of web services, which allow real-time data updates between Workday and external systems, and data management, which handles complex tasks like currency conversion and large-scale financial processing</li>

      <div class = "subheading"> Julie Kolesar 
        <span class="year">2024</span>
      </div>
      <div class = "subsubheading"> Research Engineer in the Bioengineering Department at Stanford </div>
    </div>
  <p class="takeaways">
  Ms. Kolesar has her Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Ohio State University, and since 2014 has worked in the Human Performance Lab and studied the underlying mechanisms relating biomechanical changes with function and quality of life for individuals with musculoskeletal disorders and injuries. In her talk, she: </p>
  <ul class="bulletpoints">
   <li>Introduced me to biomechanics and bioengineering and how it compares to engineering and biology</li>
   <li>Went over the human body and how it could be viewed as a the most complicated and imporant mechanical system</li>
   <li>Showed common software used in the industry, like OpenSim and OpenCap</li>
    <ul>
      <li>She currently uses OpenCap and describes it as a great advance. Previous tools used for tracking human movement require markers placed on the human body, making it inaccessible to the majority of people, but OpenCap only requires two smartphones and is completely open-source</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Discussed the responsibilities of a bioengineer, which include generating simulations of the body and investigating how and why people move the way they do, all for the purpose of improving function and quality of life</li> 
  </ul>

      <div class = "subheading"> Radhika Paliwal
        <span class="year">2023, 2024</span>
      </div>
      <div class = "subsubheading"> Sales, Stradegy, Operations at CheckBook </div>
    </div>
  <p class="takeaways">
  Ms. Paliwal's covered many topics spanning from personal goals to finances. She graduated from Purdue with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Her careers also covers a variety of fields, including being an author, Software and Test Developer at Cummins, Technical Analyst at 3M, Assosciate System Engineer and Technical Solutions Architect at Cisco, and finally Sales, Stradegy, Operations at Checkbook, where she currently works. From both her talks, I learned: </p>
  <ul class="bulletpoints">
   <li>How to set goals smart by asking myself what fields in life I proioritize and where I would see myself in the future</li>
   <li>What to do for an interview and what to expect, such as only receiving one offer out of applying one hundred times</li>
    <li> What a successful elevator pitch would look like (should include background, demonstrate interesting in the company, and shouldn't be asking for oppurtunities) </li>
   <li>I should ask questions after an interview, as it demonstrates interest and is an oppurtunity to see if I want to work for the company</li>
   <li>The five stages of an interview, which are: 
     <ul>
       <li>Greeting the interviewer with a handshake or wave if it's virtual</li>
       <li>Introducing yourself, which could be the elevator pitch, also make sure to make it interesting to make yourself stand out</li>
       <li>In the actual interview, be confident, ask clarifying questions, and be honest if you don't know</li>
       <li>Ask questions in the end, at least 1-2</li>
       <li> And finally ask when you can expect to hear back from them and thank them for their time</li>
     </ul>
   <li>Create a a three slide google slides with a theme of the companies colors</li>
   <ul>
     <li>The first slide should be {Your Name} + {Company Name}</li>
     <li>The second slide should be your professional timeline</li>
     <li>The third slide should be a 30 60 90 plan, which is where you see yourself in 30 days, 60 days, and  90 days from today</li>
     <li>This helps diffrenciate you from other people</li>
   <li>After the interview, a follow up email should be sent within 24 hours which should include a thank you, responses to questions you were unable to answer, and show appreciation</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The difference between checking, savings, and credit accounts</li>
    <li>When to use credit cards, the benefits of credit cards, and how it affects credit score</li>
  </ul>
