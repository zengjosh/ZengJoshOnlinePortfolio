<h1>PLTW 1.3.1 A Dangerous Situation <span class="year">Cybersecurity 2025</span></h1>

 <p class="project-description">
    In this project, I applied the Cybersecurity Lifecycle—Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover—to investigate and secure a compromised computer system. The task involved identifying suspicious files and processes, restoring legitimate data, running antivirus scans, reconfiguring firewall and system security settings, and removing potential threats. I also documented each step in a Security Incident Response Report to ensure the process could be replicated by others.
    <br><br>
    Through this experience, I learned how to recognize indicators of compromise, the importance of both automated tools and manual inspection in threat detection, and the limitations of antivirus software. I gained hands-on experience in incident response, data recovery, and preventative security measures. Additionally, I learned the value of collaboration in cybersecurity tasks, as working my partner Nakul helped uncover and resolve issues more effectively. This project provided a practical understanding of how cybersecurity principles apply to both individual systems and larger organizational networks.<br><br>
