 <p class="project-description">
A friend recently got me into Tetris so decided to make <a href="https://tetri.us/" target="_blank">Tetris</a> online so it would be available from almost anywhere.
   
<br><br>
   
This is my first closed source project, partly because I wanted to see how to implement security measures to protect my work, but also because many of my friends are gatekeeping information about college applications, and I too wanted something to gatekeep.
   
<br><br>
   
On top of coding the game itself, which consisted of over a thousand lines of Javascript and many, many hours of playing with the CSS, I had to make sure the code wasn't publicly available. Initially, I thought that simply making the GitHub Repository private would be enough, but then I realized that all the files were shared through the source tab using the inspect tool. I also knew I couldn't have a backend to the project or else Vercel would start charging fees and imposing limits, so I found the best option possible for me given the criteria: obfuscating the important code. This means that I would need a Next.js setup on top of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript I had currently. By bundling together the code with Terser and using Webpack Obfuscator, I was able to get the Javascript displayed in the source tab to be completely jumbled while maintaining the functionality of the game.
 
   <br><br>
   
This large project has taught me a lot and has helped me develop some skills I'd already learned. The animations for the CSS, designing UIs to look appealing, and handling the edge cases, like hard dropping a tetromino while it was in its grace period, were all helpful, making me grow as a developer and consider more cases. Implementing security was completely new, but this project as a result helped me familiarize myself with tools that I may potentially use in the future. Ultimately, I'm glad that I was able to create a fully functioning Tetris game that both my friends or anyone on the Internet, can enjoy.
