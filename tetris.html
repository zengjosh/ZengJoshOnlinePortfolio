 <p class="project-description">
A friend recently got me into Tetris so decided to make <a href="https://tetri.us/" target="_blank">Tetris</a> online so it would be available from almost anywhere.
   
<br><br>
   
This is my first closed source project, partly because I wanted to see how to implement security measures to protect my work, but also because many of my friends are gatekeeping information about college applications, and I too wanted something to gatekeep.
   
<br><br>
   
On top of coding the game itself, which consisted of over a thousand lines of Javascript and many, many hours of playing with the CSS, I had to make sure the code wasn't publicly available. Initially, I thought that simply making the GitHub Repository private would be enough, but then I realized that all the files were shared through the source tab using the inspect tool. I also knew I couldn't have a backend to the project or else Vercel would start charging fees and imposing limits, so I found the best option possible for me given the criteria: obfuscating the important code. This means that I would need a Next.js setup on top of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript I had currently. By bundling together the code with Terser and using Webpack Obfuscator, I was able to get the Javascript displayed in the source tab to be completely jumbled while maintaining the functionality of the game.
 
<br><br>

I also tried working on the search engine optimization (SEO) part of web development. This meant trying the make the website more visible, to rank it higher on Google. I started with standard suggestions like adding a meta description, favicon, title, keywords, and a canonical URL. Upon doing more research, however, I found that there was much more to add, like the Open Graph Protocol, which gave an image preview to the site whenever I shared the link on social sites, a schema markup, which helped search engines understand the page better, and a robots.txt file for selective indexing. I also improved the loading time by converting all the pictures used to WebP and using Vercel's CDN. Other features that I had already implemented, like bundling, also helped. This page itself is also helping the SEO through the added backlink.

This large project has taught me a lot and has helped me develop some skills I'd already learned. The animations for the CSS, designing UIs to look appealing, and handling the edge cases, like hard dropping a tetromino while it was in its grace period, were all helpful, making me grow as a developer and consider more cases. Implementing security was completely new, but this project as a result helped me familiarize myself with tools that I may potentially use in the future. The foray into SEO was valuable, as it familiarized how I could boost my visibility with a raw GitHub Repository instead of having help from a website editor. Ultimately, I'm glad that I was able to create a fully functioning Tetris game that both my friends or anyone on the Internet, can enjoy while being a learning experience.
