  </div>
 <p class="takeaways">
   Mr. Lewis talked to us about his career path, and the work environment at Playstation, specifically on the development of Playstation Now. He attended UC Merced and received an internship at Playstation, where he was hired after graduating. Some key takeaways from his talk include: 
   <br>
   <br>
   - The internship acts as an interview for Playstation, so performance is judged
   <br>
   - If deciding to decline a job offer until after graduating, the spot is not reserved
   <br>
    - Teams at Playstation may have different skill sets depending on their specific projects
   <br>
   - Junior engineers work on Android controller support and helped with code checks.
   <br>
   - Software engineers primarily focused on the screen share feature and Linux 
   <br>
   - Promotions come with a 15k-20k payraise
   <br>
   - PlayStation offers ample time off in exchange for lower pay
   <br>
   - Emphasizes work results over strict working hours
   <br>
   - Employees can take days off as long as no critical work is missed and they announce their vacation plans

      <div class = "subheading"> Lakshmi Hanspal </div>
      <div class = "subsubheading"> Global Chief Security Officer at Amazon Devices & Services </div>
    </div>
<p class="takeaways">
   Ms. Hanspal deals with hardware-related areas such as tablets, satellites for internet connectivity, and self-driving technology, with a primary goal of ensuring security and enhancing customer trust. She discusses the  fulfillment process for orders placed with Amazon, cloud computing, ambient intelligence, and the future of technology. Some takeaways I got from this talk were: 
   <br>
   <br>
 - Cloud computing provides readily available and scalable computing resources for building and deploying applications and services, such as video games
   <br>
  - Elastic computing involves the ability to dynamically allocate and de-allocate computing resources based on demand
  <br>
  - The future of computing involves ambient intelligence, where systems understand context and deliver personalized experiences without explicit command
  <br>
  - Large language models like chatbots are becoming increasingly prevalent and require engineers for training and continuous improvement
  <br>
  - In computing, it's crucial to protect the entire chain of data custody, including customer identity, personalization, context data, and third-party sources
  <br>
  - Collaboration with regulators and adherence to compliance standards is required for ensuring trust and transparency in computing applications.
